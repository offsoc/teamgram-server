# CRYSTALS-Dilithium Implementation Notes

This document provides technical details about our implementation of the CRYSTALS-Dilithium post-quantum digital signature algorithm.

## Algorithm Overview

CRYSTALS-Dilithium is a lattice-based digital signature scheme based on the hardness of the Module Learning With Errors (MLWE) and Module Short Integer Solution (MSIS) problems. It uses a "Fiat-Shamir with aborts" approach to convert an interactive identification scheme into a non-interactive signature scheme.

## Key Components

### Polynomial Arithmetic

The core of Dilithium involves operations on polynomials in the ring R_q = Z_q[X]/(X^n + 1), where:
- n = 256 (polynomial degree)
- q = 8,380,417 (modulus)

We implement efficient polynomial arithmetic using the Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) for fast polynomial multiplication.

### Number Theoretic Transform (NTT)

The NTT is a specialized version of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) that works in finite fields. It allows us to perform polynomial multiplication in O(n log n) time instead of O(n²).

Our implementation includes:
- Forward NTT transformation
- Inverse NTT transformation
- Point-wise multiplication in the NTT domain

### Rejection Sampling

Dilithium uses rejection sampling to ensure that the signature does not leak information about the secret key. This involves:
- Sampling polynomials with coefficients in specific ranges
- Checking if the sampled values meet certain criteria
- Rejecting and resampling if the criteria are not met

### Constant-Time Implementation

To prevent timing attacks, our implementation uses constant-time operations for all security-critical functions:
- No secret-dependent branches
- No secret-dependent memory access patterns
- Constant-time modular reduction

## Optimizations

### AVX2/AVX-512 Acceleration

When available, our implementation uses AVX2 or AVX-512 vector instructions to accelerate:
- NTT operations
- Polynomial arithmetic
- Rejection sampling

### Batch Verification

For improved performance when verifying multiple signatures, we implement batch verification that:
- Reduces the number of expensive operations
- Amortizes the cost of verification across multiple signatures
- Maintains the same security guarantees

## Security Considerations

### Side-Channel Protection

Our implementation includes protections against various side-channel attacks:
- Timing attacks: Using constant-time operations
- Cache attacks: Avoiding secret-dependent memory access patterns
- Power analysis: Minimizing secret-dependent power consumption patterns

### Secure Random Number Generation

We use cryptographically secure random number generation for:
- Key generation
- Nonce generation during signing
- Rejection sampling

## Parameter Sets

We implement all three NIST-standardized parameter sets:

1. **Dilithium2**:
   - NIST security level 2 (equivalent to AES-128)
   - Parameters: k=4, l=4, eta=2, tau=39, beta=78, gamma1=2^17, gamma2=(q-1)/88, omega=80

2. **Dilithium3**:
   - NIST security level 3 (equivalent to AES-192)
   - Parameters: k=6, l=5, eta=4, tau=49, beta=196, gamma1=2^19, gamma2=(q-1)/32, omega=55

3. **Dilithium5**:
   - NIST security level 5 (equivalent to AES-256)
   - Parameters: k=8, l=7, eta=2, tau=60, beta=120, gamma1=2^19, gamma2=(q-1)/32, omega=75

## Testing

Our implementation is thoroughly tested using:
- Unit tests for all components
- NIST Known Answer Tests (KATs)
- Randomized testing
- Performance benchmarks

## Future Improvements

Potential future improvements include:
- Further optimization of NTT operations
- Implementation of additional side-channel protections
- Integration with hardware security modules (HSM)
- Support for additional parameter sets
